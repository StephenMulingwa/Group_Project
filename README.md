**INTRODUCTION**

The movie industry is highly competitive, with countless production companies vying for the attention of global audiences. After intensive research, we were tasked to research the current film industry trends to assist in directing the company's upcoming film production endeavour. Knowing what kinds of movies are doing well at the box office will be crucial to our new movie studio's success as more businesses venture into producing original video content. I will find important patterns and trends in audience preferences by examining recent box office data. To help the studio head make well-informed decisions regarding the genres, themes, and formats that are most likely to appeal to viewers and optimize our studio's success, these insights will be converted into practical suggestions. 

## Notebook Structure


**Business Questions for the upcoming project**
1.	What genres are currently the most successful at the box office? 
2.	How does genre influence revenue and viewer ratings?
3.	How do genre and ratings impact a movie’s revenue?
4.	What patterns can be observed in successful movies, and how can these patterns inform production choices for a new studio?
5.	Is there an optimal budget range or release period that aligns with higher box office returns?

## Business Understanding  
Understanding the elements and factors that affect a movie’s performance has become essential for newcomers to the market as the entertainment sector expands. Your company intends to launch a new movie studio to optimise box office performance by determining the key factors that impact a movie’s success. The business will be able to make well-informed decisions about the types of films to make, the best times to release them, and budget allocations. 

## Project Overview  
There are many movies released annually, making the film industry extremely competitive. Numerous factors can impact a movie’s performance, and not all movies are financially successful. The genre, release date, budget, ratings and production company are some of the factors that can greatly impact a film's success or failure. However, it is difficult for the business to come up with a plan that boosts the possibility of creating box office hits if these influencing factors are not well understood.
For this project, you will use exploratory data analysis to generate insights for a business stakeholder.
